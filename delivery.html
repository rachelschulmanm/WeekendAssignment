    <h1>Delivery & collection</h1>
    <p>
        Our Rachel stores, rachel stores in Sainsbury's supermarkets and Sainsbury's collection points are operating as normal.

        For items available with Fast Track delivery choose from a choice of time slots based on your location. To protect our customers and colleagues, orders will be delivered to your doorstep, and left in a safe and sensible location.
        
        Delivery of larger items (things that need two people to get it to you, like sofas and beds) is available in England, Scotland and Wales, allowing us to deliver to your room of choice where itâ€™s safe to do so. Our friendly drivers will contact you on the day, to discuss delivering your order. If you are self-isolating, please make us aware so we can rearrange your delivery date.
        
        We are currently experiencing high demand for large item delivery. If there is a delay to your delivery, we will message you as early as possible. We are working hard to offer our customers the best service we can and thank you for your continued patience and support.
